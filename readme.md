# 3D Object Classification with Machine Learning (LiDAR Integration)

This project trains a machine learning model to classify 3D objects using a combination of synthetic and real-world data. 

* Synthetic Data: The training process leverages the well-established ModelNet10 dataset from 3DShapeNets, providing a diverse set of 3D models for model training.
* Real-World Data: LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data is utilized to test the model's performance on real-world object detection and classification tasks.
